# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application for Angular JS

This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application.

### Running the application

Open your command line to the root directory of the repository. node server.js

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/<page>.html` to see the app running in
your browser.  The port may be configured in the server.js file, app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);

### Server

The server is a simple node server using express as framework.  This keeps the entire project self-contained, but it puts some limitations because the server has no logic whatsoever.
